	<description>-Blueprint MapGenerator for Faction Bases
   This will sometimes create faction bases from the available blueprints.
   To make it not too predictable there are chances based on the count of blueprints 
      to alternately still use the vanilla generator. (85%-50% chance of vanilla)
	  
   You can also add your own blueprints to the collection.
   I've prepared a GitHub for this here:
