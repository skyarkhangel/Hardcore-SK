-GardenerBot (working template)
   This robot is a working template for you to add your own robots.
   Unmodified this is a robot that cuts down plants! It does not plant in this variant!

	1. Replace GardenerBot with whatever you want it to be
	2. Change the workTypeDef and workTag number in the AIRobot_Races.xml
	3. Replace the graphics with your graphic set

(Version: 0.14.1)
