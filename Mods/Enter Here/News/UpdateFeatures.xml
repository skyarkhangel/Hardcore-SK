    <content>In this update you can choose if Enter-spots should act as Exit-spots as well. 
You can toggle each spot between Enter only, Exit only or both.
All selected pawn-types in the options should try to use these except the traveling group. They will only use Enter-spots and then cross the map as usual as they are obviously heading somewhere.</content>
