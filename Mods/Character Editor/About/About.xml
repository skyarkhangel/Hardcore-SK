- hint: when loading xenotype - into correct gene pool, the xenotype will be prefered (when it is a prefered xenotype in pawns ideology)

- added a tooltip (when mouse is over pawns xenotype in the xenotype dialog) that shows if the current xenotype is prefered by ideology
- hint: when you load a xenotype and then add some more genes, which were not originally included in that xenotype, the xenotype will most likely not be prefered by ideology
