        <helpText>In order for colonists to be able to perform certain tasks (e.g. felling trees) efficiently, they need to have the appropriate tools (e.g. axes for felling trees).\n\nSelect a colonist, right-click a tool you want them to use, then either have them equip it in their main hand or put it in their inventory.\n\nColonists can only carry up to 3 tools at once in their inventory, so keep that in mind!</helpText>
