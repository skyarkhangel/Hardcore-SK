	<description>Customize your colonists, choose your gear and prepare carefully for your crash landing!

The mod uses a point-based system to try to maintain a balanced start.  Spend your points on additional colonists, skill points, passions, resources, weapons and apparel.

If you get a starting setup that you like, save it as a preset so that you can start your game the same way later.

[Version 0.13.1.1]
