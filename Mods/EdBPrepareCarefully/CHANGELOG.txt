 _____________________________________________________________________________
   
 - Customize a colonist's date of birth by right-clicking on their age.

      try to deal with the changes to various market values in the vanilla
      game.
    - Melee weapons now reflect the materials from which they are built.
    - Options for bionics now respect the body part hierarchy, i.e. if you
      replace a right arm with a bionic arm, you can't replace the
      corresponding right hand.
    - Reworked the colonist and preset save/load screens to match the new
      look-feel.
 - Changed the way the mod checks to see if it's active.  You can now rename
   the mod folder without affecting this check.

  _____________________________________________________________________________
 
   Version 1.3.1 (2014-11-08) 
 _____________________________________________________________________________

 - Added a "Body Parts" option above the colonist portrait.  Use it to:
    - Add bionics to your colonists.
    - Disable old injury generation on your colonists.
 - Save and load individual colonists.
 - You can now click on the skill bar to set your skill level.
 - Traits and backstories are now sorted alphabetically when you open the
   dialog to view the full list. 
 - BUGFIX: Initial work priorities are now correctly assigned based on chosen
   skill levels

   now chooses the correct one in the Backstory selection dialog.

 _____________________________________________________________________________
 
   Version 1.2.3 (2014-10-19) 
 _____________________________________________________________________________

 - Changed the multipliers for resources so that you can add smaller stacks
   and therefore have less expensive options.
 - BUGFIX: Traits are now correctly loaded from presets.  This should fix the
   random changes to the total point value when loading a preset.
 - BUGFIX: Old injuries are now correctly generated based on age.

 _____________________________________________________________________________
 
   Version 1.2.2 (2014-10-08) 
 _____________________________________________________________________________

   buttons in the bottom button row.
 - BUGFIX: The randomize apparel button should no longer break the mod.

  _____________________________________________________________________________
 
   Version 1.2.1 (2014-10-06) 
 _____________________________________________________________________________

 - The apparel customization UI now lets you select a material for apparel
   that can be crafted using "stuff."  For this type of apparel, the color
   that you select blends with the default color of the material to determine
   the final apparel color.
 - Apparel in the equipment screen is now listed separately by material.
 - Added a third trait slot.
 - Tweaked the maximum number of points and the colonist point costs.
 - Right-clicking the passion indicator lowers the passion level instead of
   increasing it.
 - Added some additional error handling so that the mod gives up when there's
   a fatal error instead of continuing to log an error every frame.  May not
   cover every scenario, but it should be better.
 - Skills no longer go below zero (since negative numbers no longer impact a
   colonist's "market value").
 - Removed the neurotrainer.  It wasn't working correctly, and it doesn't
   really make sense to add it when you can just increase your colonists
   skill on the character screen--for far fewer points.
 - Changed the preset file format so that it is now more forgiving when you
   enable and disable mods.  You'll see an error message telling you that
   some definitions failed to load.  To see which definitions, look at the
   console.  Old preset files should still work, but no promises.  I
   recommend re-saving them so that they are stored in the new file format.
 - BUGFIX: No longer tries to create apparel out of synthread if that apparel
   cannot be "made of stuff."

   starting equipment.

   options available for selection.
 - You can now start with up to ten colonists.

   change backstories.

 _____________________________________________________________________________
 
   Version 1.0.5 (2014-09-27)

 - Added all backstories.  A backstory will now show a warning if its
   description may not match the name or gender of the colonist that you
   selected.
 - Added a checkbox option to the lower-left corner of the window that allows
   you disable the point system.  This replaces the option you used to see
   when right-clicking the points label.
 - The Load/Save Preset dialogs do a better job of remembering where you
   were when you close them.
 - BUGFIX: Skill levels are now correctly saved to presets and are correctly
   reflected when the game starts.

   the game begins.
 - BUGFIX: Skill point tooltips now immediately reflect changes.

   your backstory and gender.  The body type applied to your colonists when
   the game begins should now match the one shown in the mod UI.

   the mod is disabled.
