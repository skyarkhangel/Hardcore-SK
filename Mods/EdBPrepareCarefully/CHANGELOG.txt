   Version 1.2.1 (2014-10-06) 
 _____________________________________________________________________________

   a fatal error instead of continuing to log an error every frame.  May not
   cover every scenario, but it should be better.
 - Skills no longer go below zero (since negative numbers no longer impact a
   colonist's "market value").
 - Removed the neurotrainer.  It wasn't working correctly, and it doesn't
   really make sense to add it when you can just increase your colonists
   skill on the character screen--for far fewer points.
 - Changed the preset file format so that it is now more forgiving when you
   enable and disable mods.  You'll see an error message telling you that
   some definitions failed to load.  To see which definitions, look at the
   console.  Old preset files should still work, but no promises.  I
   recommend re-saving them so that they are stored in the new file format.
 - BUGFIX: No longer tries to create apparel out of synthread if that apparel
   cannot be "made of stuff."

   were when you close them.
