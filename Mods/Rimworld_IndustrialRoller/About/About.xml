	Free your haulers! Industrial Rollers lets you build your own roller system which lets you transport goods to their destination without colonist interaction.
	Simply add a stockpile on top of the rails and direct your roller system to stockpiles. items will then be automatically carried to desired destination. 
	Add Roller pushers to scan goods and redirect them to different rollers.
