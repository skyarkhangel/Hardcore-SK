	<li>It was the third day of a long and painfull siege,</li>
	<li>James and Rookie were dead and burried, and I had my right ear blown off.</li>
	<li>David, our sniper, decided to take it upon himself to free us from this nightmare.</li>
	<li>As he stealthly sneaked about the grass, looking for the raiders' base,</li>
	<li>he suddenly wispered urgently at the coms.</li>
	<li>With my one ear I could make out that one distress signal we never want to hear;</li>
	<li>"MAD BOOMRAT!"</li>
	<li>A loud bang sounded far off.</li>
	<li>with my pistol in hand, and the coms eerily silent, I opened the colony door.</li>
	<li>The entire plain was on fire.</li>
	<li>Looking far away, I saw the fire slowly crawling towards the raiders' base.</li>
	<li>As the fires reached their cannons, 2 horrible explosions burned at my eyes</li>
	<li>I was never as happy to feel the rain pour, as that night.</li>
	<li>I never did find David's body, </li>
	<li>but as soon as I could, I built a statue in his honour.</li>
