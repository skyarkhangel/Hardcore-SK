    <AdvancedResearchDef>
    
        <defName>string</defName>       [required] Some unique identifier in class
        
        <Priority>int</Priority>        [required] Lower values is happen first
        
        <researchDefs>                  [required] All the research listed must be complete for anything to happen
            <li>ResearchProjectDef</li>
        </researchDefs>
        
        <HideDefs>bool</HideDefs>       [optional: false] Set to true to disable (hide) or false to enable
        
        <helpCategoryDef>HelpCategoryDef</helpCategoryDef>
                                        [optional: null] If set, this def will generate a help menu entry in the specified category
        
        <ConsolidateHelp>bool</ConsolidateHelp>
                                        [optional: false] If true, this def will be find all other research projects with the same
                                        research requirements and aggregate the data into one entry
        
        <HideUntilResearched>bool</HideUntilResearched>
                                        [optional: false] If true, the help menu entry for this def will not be shown in the help
                                        menu until the research to unlock it is complete.
        
        <label>string</label>           [optional: null] If set, this will be used for the HelpDef label
        
        <description>string</description> [optional: null] If set, this will be used for the base HelpDef description

        Notes on generating HelpDefs:
        
        Using a <Priority> of -1 and a single researchDef prerequisite indicates that this def is
        used to generate a help menu entry for a single research project, typicially with the
        ConsolidateHelp flag set to true.  (See the Vanilla Tweaks Help Menu Builders)
        
        If there is only one researchDef for the def, the <label> and <description> tags can be
        left null to use the label and description from the researchDef.
        
        If there is more than one researchDef, the <label> and <description> must be supplied
        and must not be null.
        
        <ConsolidateHelp> set to true, when creating the description from the def data, it matches
        other advanced research defs by having the exact same researchDefs list (order-irrelavent).
        This enabled it to aggregate information about all matching research into one help menu entry.
        
        <recipeDefs>                    [optional: null] Recipes to toggle on buildings, requires <thingDefs>
            <li>RecipeDef</li>          with <thingClass> implementing "IBillGiver"
        </recipeDef>
        
        <sowTags>                       [optional: null] Plant sowTags to toggle, requires <thingDefs> with
            <li>string</li>             <thingClass> "Plant"
        </sowTags>
        
        <thingsDefs>                    [optional: null] The things to effect depending on other tags,
            <li>ThingDef</li>           If no other dependant tags exist, toggles buildings in the architect tabs
        </thingDefs>                    with a valid <designationCategory> (must not be null or "None")
        
        <effectedResearchDefs>          [optional: null] Research projects to unlock or lock, can be used to
            <li>ResearchProjectDef</li> create exclusive branches of research
        </effectedResearchDefs>
        
        <researchMods>                  [optional: null] Mod callback Actions, these will happen after everything else has been processed
            <li>Action( bool disable = true )</li>
        </researchMods>
        
    </AdvancedResearchDef>

    NOTE:  AdvancedResearchDefs will automagically lock and unlock the things they unlock and lock respectively if the conditions to lock
    and unlock them have not been met (researchDefs are not complete).  This frees you from having to specifically handle their initial state.

    NOTE:  When using AdvancedResearchDefs, you must also create a ModHelperDef.  Important information is required in the ModHelperDef
    which is used to control how your mod is handled and what functionality is available to it.  Without creating a ModHelperDef, CCL will
    discard all AdvancedResearchDefs from your mod and an error will be thrown.  The requirement of the ModHelperDef has always existed
    but it is now (v0.12.5+) enforced.
