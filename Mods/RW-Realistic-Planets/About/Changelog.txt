  Changelog for "Rainbeau's Realistic Planets"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For changes after 12/05/2018 by Saucy_Pigeon, please see: https://github.com/SaucyPigeon/RW-Realistic-Planets-Fan-Update/releases

- 12/05/2018
	- Revised acacia tree stats to match those of acacia trees in "Vegetable
	  Garden." The trees have different defNames, so you may still end up with
	  both versions of acacia on a map if you're using both mods, but the only
	  difference now is visual; in terms of wood yield, etc., they are identical.
	- Fixed an error created by the fact that "Infectious Creatures" redefines
	  cobras in a way that made the mod think they were mod-added rather than
	  vanilla creatures.
	- Rewrote XML patches to improve load efficiency slightly.

- 11/30/2018
	- Fixed a bug that resulted in faction settlement generation being aborted
	  if a faction added by a mod generated without a leader.
	  
- 11/29/2018
	- Added options to have the placement of faction settlements take racial
	  temperature preferences into consideration and/or to have each faction's
	  settlements "grouped" to simulate actual nations. (These options are
	  automatically disabled if "Faction Control" is also in use.)

- 11/27/2018
	- Fixed a stunningly stupid typo that was causing most ocean tiles to be 
	  replaced by sea ice.
	  
- 11/27/2018
	- Added an option to allow adjustment of the planet's axial tilt.
	- If you're using this mod in conjunction with "My Little Planet," world size
	  will now be correctly saved with the game data, so planets will no longer
	  revert to standard RimWorld size when a game is reloaded.

- 11/26/2018
	- Biome placement now takes seasonal temperature variation into consideration
	  instead of looking only at average temperature. This should prevent forest
	  or grassland biomes showing up in tiles with growing periods of 0 days.
	- Undid a change to vanilla ice sheet placement which prevented ice sheets
	  from appearing where rainfall was extremely low. So cold planets, even if
	  very dry, will once again have ice caps.
	- Replaced the previous alteration of vanilla temperature ranges, which did
	  little beyond making the equatorial regions of cold planets colder, with a
	  more extensive "stretching" of the scale, so cold planets are colder at all
	  latitudes than vanilla cold planets, and hot planets are hotter.
	- Added patches so that "Misc. MapGen Xtension 'Urban Biome'" biomes generate
	  correctly on this mod's planets.
	- Added patches to allow "FishIndustry" fish to be caught in this mod's new
	  biomes.
	- Renamed the "ocean size" slider as "sea level," which makes more sense.
	
- 11/23/2018
	- Minor bug fix to remove error messages if "Permafrost" isn't installed.
	
- 11/22/2018
	- Initial release.
