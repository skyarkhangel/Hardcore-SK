      |The keybindings for following and cinematic cameras are now much more configurable. Look for them in Follow Me!'s options page. Click the curent binding to change it, and you can now also use modifier keys (Alt, Shift, etc.) as well as mouse buttons!
      |Note that existing keybindings for Follow Me! have been reset to the default 'Home' to toggle following, and 'End' to loop over Cinematic Cameras.
