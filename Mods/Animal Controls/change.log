1.0.14
- updated for new base game patch;

1.0.13
- imagine 1.4. Expect bugs, barely tested;

other
- german by Dimos;

1.0.12
- mod broke due to latest game patch. Fixed an error. I hope nothing else changed;

1.0.11
- ludeion fixed an issue with pawns ignoring restriction on drugs and plants, so I've removed some crutchy fixes;
- fixed food restriction window;

1.0.10
- added back "other edible" category, because although 1.3 now has all other edible stuff in the restriction, it doesn't work because they're not in a food category. Not on animals anyway;

1.0.9
- increased limit slider from max 1 to max 10. But, serisously? That's some dino sized meals you've got there (1.2, 1.3);

1.0.8
- managed to finally catch a problem with animals staring at a handler until they pass out from exhaustion. Fixed it (1.2, 1.3);

1.0.7
- minor compatibility patch to address GUI overlap with SaveStorageSettings mod (1.2, 1.3);

1.0.6
- fixed an issue with pawns picking up a lot of meals in 1.3;
- added a slider to change max. nutrition limit (1.2, 1.3);

1.0.5
- things for 1.3;
- hey, 1.3 has it's own Plants food category!
- drugs are not "ingestibles" any more. What's left can be seen in food by default;

1.0.4
- added "other edible" category to the Foods category. Everything that doesn't go to the plants, is ingestible, but isn't in Foods category, goes to Other Edible;
- you can now restrict everything else that can be eaten.

1.0.3
- fixed an issue, due to which handlers would take a lot of meals trying to start taming\training action, but still wouldn't do the action (handlers not suposed to use big meals at all);

1.0.2
- added Chinese Simplified translation. Thanks, HawnHan!

1.0.1
- my stupid forgot to initialize settings. Added them to the game. Oops;
