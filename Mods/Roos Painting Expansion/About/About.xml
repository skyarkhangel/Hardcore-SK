<description>• I’m an artist. Can I sculpt? Not for toffee. Can I paint? Well, not really. Nevertheless, what I’m saying is that your artist pawns should be capable of so much more than just sculpting.

------------------

• This mod adds in a new art form: paintings. Pawns can create either classical or modern paintings that draw from a unique pool of graphics and descriptions.

• The mod works without any DLC or other mods. But when Ideology is installed, what your pawns paint depends entirely on your ideological style.

• Research the arts, construct an easel and start painting. Decorate your art studio with cosmetic props, such as canvases and paint spills- or even construct an art cabinet to help catalyse your artist’s next masterpiece. Pawns can be decked out with artsy-fartsy apparel and tattoos too, because what’s art without getting to wear a fancy beret?

• In total, with Ideology installed, there are over 40+ unique paintings your pawns can create.
