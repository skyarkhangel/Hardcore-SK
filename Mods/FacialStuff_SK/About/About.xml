For modders:
- Walk cycle editor. Check out the develop mode in the mod options
- A tab for positioning the hands on weapons, also activated with the dev mode; can export directly to xml.

+ hair textures with beards from the &apos;Spoonshortage&apos;s Rimworld Hairstyles 1.2&apos; and &apos;Nackblad Inc Rimhair 1.1&apos; mods are replaced by shaved versions
  This mod contains no hair packs itself any more. Please subscribe to the hair mods of your liking.

Patches the PawnRenderer via Harmony and returns &apos;false&apos; thus being incompatible to mods doing the same.
Look out for the FS "Alien Faces" addon if you're using erdelf's Humanoid Alien Framework.

Unfortunately no hands on lightsabers, as the OversizedWeapons prefixes the required method.
