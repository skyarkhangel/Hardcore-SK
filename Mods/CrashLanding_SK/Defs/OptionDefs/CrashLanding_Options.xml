		<!-- <modeIsHard> controls how your colonists arrived to the Rimworld.
			false - Corresponds easy mode, when your start colonists land safely using drop pods. Other random colonists will crash land and take serious damage.
			true - Corresponds hard mode, when all colonists, even your starting ones, will crash land hard and may be dead on arrival.-->
		<modeIsHard>false</modeIsHard>

		<!-- <disableRain> controls force rain disable during the starting event.
			false - No changes in weather control. And this means that rain will start in several hours after game start due to major fires.
			true - Rain will be disabled during the starting event. You will need to beat the fire on your own. There is no any weather control outside the starting event. This is a recommended option. -->
		<disableRain>false</disableRain>

		<!-- <rainTimeDelay> controls the time delay before the rain become possible.
			Measured in hours. How long there will be no rain from the time of last part fallen.
			It is not control the exact rain time, only the time when the rain is prohibited. Default is 2.0. -->
		<rainTimeDelay>1.0</rainTimeDelay>

		<!-- <partsTimeDelayMultiplier> controls the time delay between falling ship parts.
			Time delay is random, but it is multiplied by this value.
			You can increase (above 1.0) or decrease (between 0 and 1.0) time delay. You can even put it to 0, to make all ship parts fall simultaniously. Default is 1.0. -->
		<partsTimeDelayMultiplier>1.0</partsTimeDelayMultiplier>

		<!-- <crashlandedPawnsDamage> controls the amount of damage dealt to the pawns during crashlanding.
			This value is not the exact damage dealt to pawns. Real damage based on this value, pawn size and random value.
			Decreasing this value can significantly increase the number of survived colonists. Setting this value to 0, does not prevent pawns from damage at all, they still get a little scratches. Default is 50. -->
		<crashlandedPawnsDamage>50</crashlandedPawnsDamage>

		<!-- <crashlandedStartColonistsDamage> controls the amount of damage dealt to the start colonists during crashlanding.
			This is the same as <crashlandedPawnsDamage>, but only affects your start colonists. Default is 30. -->
		<crashlandedStartColonistsDamage>30</crashlandedStartColonistsDamage>

		<!-- <colonistPerBlockCount> controls the number of colonists in one criptosleep block.
			The starting colonists does not ue this value, and are arrived in the first block.
			Using the colonistPerBlockCount value and crashlandedPawnsDamage value, you can adjust the randomness of the mod. Default is 5. -->
		<colonistPerBlockCount>5</colonistPerBlockCount>

		<!-- <fillStartColonistsBlock> controls the number of colonists in the starting criptosleep block.
			If set true, the starting colonists cryptosleep block will contain additional random colonists. Their number is excactly enough to reach the <colonistPerBlockCount> value.
			Default is false. -->
		<fillStartColonistsBlock>false</fillStartColonistsBlock>
