   This mod adds the option to build beehives where you can harvest your very own honey.
   You need to research 'beekeeping'. Once done you can look out for wild beehives where you can find queen bees waiting to be transferred to your own beehive.
   With your beehives you can grow new queens to expand your hives. They will also produce honey for you to eat or sell.

   
   
Hints:
- You can find queen bees in dead trees or maybe with exotic good traders.
- Make sure you have enough flowers near your beehive or it'll reduce the honey production.
- The honey production is also reduced in fall and completely disabled in winter.
- Honey will be harvested when it is full.
- Mead (honey-wine) can be produced at the brewery
