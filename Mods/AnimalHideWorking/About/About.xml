  <description>This mod adds the following to the game:

============
• Rugs for all vanilla animals.
• Taxidermy for all vanilla animals.
============

How to place a rug:
============
First you'll need to obtain an animals leather. That is done by butchering an animal. Once you have obtained it's leather, you can place a rug down that is made from the leather of the corresponding creature.

How to taxidermy an animal:
============
You'll need to build a taxidermy table, which is found in the Production tab. In the bills tab of the taxidermy table, you can choose which kinds of animals to stuff. Each one requires the corpse of the corresponding animal, and a decent amount of cloth. The amount of cloth depends on the size of the animal. It ranges from as little as 15 cloth (for a Hare) to as much as 75 (Muffalo, Rhino, etc).
Once taxidermied, it works like a piece of art which can be placed anywhere and/or sold to traders.
