    <description>Version 5.0.0

        This mod creates a new option in the "Architect" menu, called "Planning", with more options for planning.

        Features:
        - 10 customizable planning designations;
        - Show/hide planning designations;
        - Control planning opacity;
        - Cut/copy/paste planning designations;
        - An option for control if planning designations should be removed when something is built or deconstructed on top of it.
        - Holding shift you can override others planning designations.

        &lt;color=red&gt;This mod uses HugsLib (need to be installed and loaded before More Planning) and Harmony (comes with the mod, no need to be installed).&lt;/color&gt;
