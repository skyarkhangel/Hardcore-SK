		This was changed from being hard-coded in pre v0.11.0.0 to
		being defined in defs to allow modders to more easily integrate
		A2B into modpiles and users to tweak settings to their own
		tastes.
		
		Hints:
		Base - How much without research
		Offset - Added to base after research is complete
		Research - All listed research must be complete
