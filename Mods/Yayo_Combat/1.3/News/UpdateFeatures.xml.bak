- Option added. Enemies use anti-armor rocket launchers


- Armor algorithm -

If the penetration of a weapon is high, the durability of the armor is sharply reduced.

Reduce enemy armor's durability first with weapons with high tech levels and high penetration. And put the bullets at the weakened ones
This also applies to mechanoids, where the bullet hits when the hp is below a certain value.

Use the newly added weapon, anti-armor rocket launcher, when fighting powerful armor enemies.
