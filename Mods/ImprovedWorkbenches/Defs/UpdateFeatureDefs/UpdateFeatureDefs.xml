        <defName>ImprovedWorkbenches_17_7_0</defName>
        <assemblyVersion>17.7.0</assemblyVersion>

Choosing one makes the worker store the finished item in that specific stockpile (assuming that stockpile is set to allow that item).|* When bill target mode is set to "Do Until X", you can now specify that only products in a specific stockpile are counted.|* For clothing bills set to "Do Until X", you can now specify that clothing worn by colonists should also be counted.|* Added buttons near the "Target Count" and "Pause Until" sliders that let you enter values in via the keyboard.|* Mod's UI controls have been moved around in the dialog to fit them all without taking too much space in the recipe info column. The worker restriction button is now in the second column.</content>

    <defName>ImprovedWorkbenches_18_6_0</defName>
    <assemblyVersion>18.6.0</assemblyVersion>
    <content>* When a single bill is copied, a "Paste Into" button now appears on every other bill, in the bill details and workbench overview screen. This button will paste all compatible settings from the source bill into the target bill, except for the output product itself. For e.g., you can create a number of tailoring jobs for different items of clothing, adjust the production counts and material filters for one and paste these into all the others. Any job's settings can be pasted into another, but not all settings are compatible between all recipes; incompatible settings will not be copied.|* When a linked bill is suspended or unsuspended, now all linked bills will take on the same status (can be configured in Settings).</content>
