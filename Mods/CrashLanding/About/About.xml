This mod changes the game start. It adds a new event, that drop a different spaceship parts on the landing site from the sky. Pods with colonists, containers with resources, engines with flammable fuel, and other useful and dangerous things. This event triggers at the start of the game, so your arrival will be much more similar to the movie crash landing. With the fire, explosions, dead and wounded people.

You will need to organize the rescue of wounded colonists and supplies. The fire will be your main enemy. It will start as small fires on the impact tiles, but quickly grow in major fire. Beat the small fires or evacuate supplies. Watch out for other dangers.

This tries to add a new gameplay, when you need to choose between resources and wounded peoples. And may be between wounded and maimed.

There are two modes: Easy and Hard
    Easy mode means, that you start with 3 healthy colonists and standard equipment. While some more random colonists will be crash-landing hard with little chance of surviving the impact.
    Hard mode means, that your starting colonists and equipment will crash land and take severe damage. Then, some more random colonists will be crash-landing hard with little chance of surviving the impact.
