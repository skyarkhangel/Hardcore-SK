[center][size=20pt]Crash Landing[/size][/center]

[color=orange][size=18pt]Description:[/size][/color]
This mod changes the game start. It adds a new event, that drop a different spaceship parts on the landing site from the sky. Pods with colonists, containers with resources, engines with flammable fuel, and other useful and dangerous things. This event triggers at the start of the game, so your arrival will be much more similar to the movie crash landing. With the fire, explosions, dead and wounded people.

You will need to organize the rescue of wounded colonists and supplies. The fire will be your main enemy. It will start as small fires on the impact tiles, but quickly grow in major fire. Beat the small fires or evacuate supplies. Watch out for other dangers.

This tries to add a new gameplay, when you need to choose between resources and wounded peoples. And may be between wounded and maimed.

There are two modes: Easy and Hard
    Easy mode means, that you start with 3 healthy colonists and standard equipment. While some more random colonists will be crash-landing hard with little chance of surviving the impact.
    Hard mode means, that your starting colonists and equipment will crash land and take severe damage. Then, some more random colonists will be crash-landing hard with little chance of surviving the impact.

[code]
V 5.02 (20.09.2015)
- Fixed Incompatibility with Combat Realism:
  - Some filters added for weapon generation
  - Use vanila independent explosive bullets
- Fixed Capital letter of Wasteland

V 5.01 (09.09.2015)
- Fixed Medicine Container
- Fixed Capital letters

V 5.00 (08.09.2015)
- Updated for A12d
- New ship part: Domestic Animal Pens.

V 4.32 (23.07.2015)
- New option in OptionDefs: fillStartColonistsBlock - controls the number of colonists in starting cryptosleep block.
- Renamed Textures and Languages directory. First letter in uppercase.
- If there is no prisoners faction in the world (old saves and worlds), the prisoners should be generated for hostile spacer faction.

V 4.31 (06.07.2015)
- Recompiled for A11b.

V 4.30 (29.06.2015)
- Added new random crashes... It is not what you thinking about. It is a new event, that can happen during the game, when different small spaceships crashlands near your colony.
- Reworked parts generation algorithm.
- Created templates for crashlanding events. Templates are used for parts generation and located in CrashLanding\defs\CrashTemplateDefs\. You can now adjust, how parts are generated in starting event and random events, and even add your own templates for random crash events. See description in corresponding xml files.
- Added a new ship part: Trade goods container - it contains a mixed type of goods.
- New option in OptionDefs: partsTimeDelayMultiplier - controls the time delay between ship's parts falling.
- Old option is removed: dangeroustPartsChanceMultiplier - since there are crashTemplates, and this option is not needed anymore.
- Removed all vanila replacements except MapGeneration. This will lower the chances of mods incompatibility.
- Reduced the crash damage to starting colonists. You should now have a capable colonist at the game start, however it is still random. It is a necessary measure, because a new generation algorithm is truly random, and the next cryptosleep block can only fall at the end of crashlanding event.

V 4.10 (19.06.2015)

- Apparel now protects from radiation:
   - Any apparel give some protection based on covered body parts. Torso +20%, legs +10%, head and ears +10%, eyes +10%, but full head gives you +50% total. That mean full power armor gives you 80%.
   - This system can work with any apparel mods, for example: gas mask from Apparello mod give you +50% since it cover full head, hazard suit from industrialization mod gives you 80%.
   - This system is not very realistic, but it works with any mod. 
- Reactor's radiation now damages plants, certain equipment and terrain.

   - Easy. Works as ordinary.
   - Hard. Starting with random colonists, that crashlanded like all others.
- This mod can work alone, as it was earlie. But no crashlanding for starting colonists.
- Reactor still very dangerous, but get a new feature: It produces power! You can connect crashed reactor to your power net and get free energy. Of course, for a price of safety.
	Dont forget to remove home zone in the irradiated area. And be on guard, if your colonists decide to walk near reactor.
- Various balance tweaks
- Not more than one AI Core and one reactor in single event.
