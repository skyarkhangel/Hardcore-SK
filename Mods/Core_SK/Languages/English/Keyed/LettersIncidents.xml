  <LetterLabelFeenixPasses>Feenix wandering through!</LetterLabelFeenixPasses>
  <LetterFeenixPasses>A Feenix is wandering through the area. \n\nBest described as a mixture of a lion and a phoenix, these legendary creatures are also known as fire incarnate. Said to be living fire, a Feenix heart is highly prized on the black market. \n\nWhile not inherintly hostile, even a solitary Feenix can lay waste to an entire colony if provoked. \n\nThey can be tamed and even trained, but only by the bravest - and most fireproof - of men.</LetterFeenixPasses>
