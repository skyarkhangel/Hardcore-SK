  <LabelRaid>Raid Stories</LabelRaid>
 
 <DescRaid_A> tells an astounding story: "They attacked in the morning. We attacked them back in the evening. We figured it was too hard for them to see us in the dead of night in the middle of a snowstorm. We were right. They tried to call for allies to help but it was too late. That's how I got those snazzy fur pants".</DescRaid_A> 
 
 <DescRaid_B> shares memories: "So these raiders we had once, it was like a gladiator match. You know, like those ancient warriors with the swords and fighting animals and stuff. Yeah, I was watching them fight off these Feralisks. It wasn't much of a fight really, they really sucked as gladiators. We did get some neat stabby weapons and armor from what was left of their bodies though".</DescRaid_B> 
 
 <DescRaid_C> recalls an interesting experience: "So we get the order to attack, and so we did. We armed the autoturrets, cannons and missile launchers and we fired. Our enemy was carrying bows, arrows and clubs. Some of us just sat inside and watched the mayhem happen, casually rocking in a chair while sipping brandy. When the chaos was over, that's when we learned that those "enemies" were actually our allies. Whoops, our bad! Time to start up the negotiations again".</DescRaid_C> 
 
 <DescRaid_D> tries to recall a snow mission: "It was cold, really cold. There were these things, they looked like people but they were slow. Real slow. We'd shoot at them and they'd kind of just stand there. It's like they were already dead or something, but they could still move. It was good target practice until you hit them in the head, then they flop over".</DescRaid_D> 
 
 <DescRaid_E> diverged some hot memories of an unforgettable battle that it was involved in: "There was this explosion, and this hand comes flying out of it. So I'm looking and looking but there's no crash capsule, no body or anything. That's when I see it, this thing melting up from the ground. It was a Terminatrix..."</DescRaid_E>

 <DescRaid_F> recalls: "There was an unscheduled inspection of our power quality. The inspector went to the batteries first and fried them. It was a Terminatrix in disguise. We tried to freeze it, but it fried the power circuits too. That's when Stan came by with a fresh batch of fusion grenades. He was asking where to store them when the Terminatrix stabbed him, blowing both of them up".</DescRaid_F> 
 
 <DescRaid_G> shares the message: "We were having a party once. Near the end of it there was fireworks and we all cheered. That's about when the solar generator blew up and we realized that it wasn't fireworks. It was explosives being fired at us. It worked to start fires, so it was kind of like fireworks, yeah?".</DescRaid_G> 
 
 <DescRaid_H> shares his thoughts: "I'm even starting to like here, friends. I can buy a couple of automatic turrets and rig up some robots to collect corpses and debris, and then sit back and relax. The silver will flow like a river..."</DescRaid_H>
 
 <DescRaid_I> says: "Although more is better when it comes to turrets and robots, you shouldn't try to communicate with Mechanoids. They'll just infect our systems with viruses. If you really want to communicate with them, do it with mortar shells. They are well versed in that kind of communication".</DescRaid_I> 
 
 <DescRaid_J> says: "Yesterday I saw corpses. Today I'll see corpses. Tomorrow I won't see corpses. I know how it works. Someone around here likes to butcher the corpses. I wonder if that person views the bodies as people, or as big slabs of meat waiting to be processed. I may never find out. Oh look, angry visitors! I could use a new set of clothing. Now where did that butcher table go..."</DescRaid_J> 
 
 <DescRaid_K> happily sings: "We came for a big feast, we gathered up our beasts. Tonight the mortars will dance, flapping metal wings to prance. Reign fire, set the sky ablaze! Burn, burn buuurrrnnn it all!"</DescRaid_K>
 
 <DescRaid_L> encouraging shouts: "This one time we going to talk to some raiders. They communicated with gunfire. We decided to talk back with mortars. The mortars shoot into the air and produce a hissing and buzzing sound and then they explode. Our talks went smoothly. We encouraged them to flee, scurrying away like ants. Let's do the same thing here!"</DescRaid_L> 
 
 <DescRaid_M> yells: "Who else did not come off - the gun in his hands and ran to the loopholes in the search for the enemy sights. Elimination of long-range special group advancing to the infection site of the estate! The remaining pronouns pronounces himself! Take in the night, all is quiet, with a glamor, glitter, and I do not eat rations before the assignment, and right in the face of the enemy! More resentment, uncultured consider ... "</DescRaid_M> 
 
 <DescRaid_N> talks about IED traps: "So we rigged up this trap with some heavy ordinance mortar shells. We dared Jerry to make it completely obvious with a sign on the trigger. 'Pull me to win a prize!' it said. We thought we had won the bet easy, nobody would ever pull the obvious trap. One of those native Norbal guys pulled it. I lost 200 silver that day and my best bottle of wine."</DescRaid_N> 
 
 <DescRaid_O> chats about a game of Miss-iles and Hits: "So we were playing a game with the missile launcher. We were trying to hit this guy that was running around randomly screaming things. Every time you miss, you drink a shot of booze. A couple of bottles later we hit this Mechanoid thing. I guess it had been chasing the guy around the whole time. A hit is a hit, so that game was over."</DescRaid_O>

 <DescRaid_P> prepares for battle:" So, everyone get ready for the next step Marlezonskogo ballet with swords. Patrons at all enough? Stress group stripping reported that mortars also destroyed the rest, cheers comrades, we are waiting for a brighter tomorrow today and wholesale! Because now they rush back to the terrible begovne with perturbed and resentful crowd of scoundrels, eager to our good behind, right on the fins and tail. And still these rascals shoot them and often even fall ... in the. How they do not like something! "</DescRaid_P> 
 
 <DescRaid_Q> retells an experience of battle: "We thought we were under attack. Mick was shooting the machinegun in bursts. Nobody else knew what to shoot at, there wasn't anything there. That's when we realized what Mick was doing. He was using the machinegun to draw crude things on a nearby mountain. Classic Mick move right there."</DescRaid_Q> 
 
 <DescRaid_R> came out of hiding and shouted: "The manuscript-and-a-shnaya! Next to the bayonet! Urine their shafts, poke sleepers, kicked, than there and where popadёsh!"</DescRaid_R> 
 
 <DescRaid_S> does not want to go to jail. Not again.</DescRaid_S> 
 
 <DescRaid_T> recalls a previous battle: "Phew it was repulsing. The embrasures had corpses lying around everywhere. There was a haze from exploded grenades. It all happened when a RPG hit our main turret. A few of use got out mostly unharmed, except a guy named Hans. He was whimpering and rocking back and forth. He was mentally broken. Poor guy."</DescRaid_T>

 <DescRaid_U> recalls an event: "It was a hospital, right next to the kitchen. They would move the critically wounded right into the kitchen. The less wounded stayed in the hopistal. There were military soldiers sitting at a table, laughing as they ate a meaty breakfast. One of them remarked how fresh his meal was. The cook happily smiled and winked. Only the freshest ingredients got used in his kitchen".</DescRaid_U>
 
 
  <LabelTrySuicide>Attempted Suicide</LabelTrySuicide>
  <DescTrySuicide> tried to commit suicide, but it did not work out.</DescTrySuicide>
  <LabelSuicide>Prisoner Suicide</LabelSuicide>
  <DescSuicide_A>One of your prisoners died in the cell and has left a final message behind. It reads: "Cameras everywhere. Watching. Always watching. The walls all around are moving, watching. Can't sleep, always watching. You see me and I don't see you! No lights here, no no. Watch you in the dark they do. Cameras, eyes of spies! You'll watch me no more!"</DescSuicide_A>

  <DescSuicide_B>Your prisoner smashed it's head against the wall and has died. A small piece of paper nearby has a message that was hastily scrawled. It reads: "I thought there would be easy cash in this Colony...but instead I got trapped into something horrible. I think I'm going crazy. This food...the Warden said it was "yummy, tasty, mmm" but I don't believe it. Something tastes wrong about it. My old injuries still haunt me, like a nightmare that never ends. Even the barely audible sound of the door causes me to shudder as if it were thunder".</DescSuicide_B>

  <DescSuicide_C>A prisoner has committed suicide shortly after asking a Colonist: "Where are my meals? I need nourishment! Muffalo meat or something! GIVE ME FOOD!"</DescSuicide_C>

  <DescSuicide_D>A prisoner who was found dead had kept a diary with multiple entries. It reads: "A rough cough. I feel cold and hot. I caught something, a flu maybe? No ventilation in here. Cough getting worse. My mouth is dry, it tastes like rust*blood splatter covers some words*rible. I see people sometimes, they promised me a future. To think I even liked it! I was promised food, a good bed and could one day use my skills again. I believed that, but not anymore. I need*blood splatter covers more words* worth a try.</DescSuicide_D>

  <DescSuicide_E>A prisoner was found deceased under the bed. A small note was crumpled up nearby. It angrily reads: "They wanted to operate on me! They were going to harvest me for organs! These people are crazies! YOU WON'T HARVEST ME ALIVE! I WON'T LET YOU!</DescSuicide_E>

  <DescSuicide_F>A prisoner has succumbed. A quick look at the body shows signs of infection and gangrene in hidden areas. The pain must have be extruciating.</DescSuicide_F>
  
  <DescSuicide_G>A prisoner has perished. Scrawled into the floor is a note. It reads: "Suddenly no one comes? Am I going to die here like an abandoned dog in a cage?".</DescSuicide_G> 
  
  <DescSuicide_H>One of your prisoners suddenly couldn't stand up. The doctor's first thought was that the prisoner's psyche was tender, overwhelmed by the anxiety and depression from imprisonment. Then the prisoner suddenly died! Upon the autopsy examination, a long fat stick was found up the prisoner's rear and had gouged the intestines. What an unfortunate circumstance.</DescSuicide_H>

  <DescSuicide_I>A prisoner has died under mysterious circumstances. The body was found in the fetal position with its hands covering its eyes. The prisoner seems to have choked when it swallowed its own tongue.</DescSuicide_I>

  <DescSuicide_J>A prisoner has died under mysterious circumstances. A quick inspection of the body tells the tale. The prisoner seems to have tried hanging itself with a boot lace, but the lace broke. The prisoner then tried to gnaw off the door handle, as indicated by the bloody bite marks on the door. Failing that the prisoner swallowed part of the boot, where it got lodged in the throat and the prisoner suffocated.</DescSuicide_J>

  <DescSuicide_K>The prisoner died under mysterious circumstances. A medical summary paper was found nearby. It reads: "Patient has distemper, intestinal ticks and show signs of being in a delirious state. Patient has tried to eat it's own feet and hands. I recommend isolating the patient and attempting experimental procedures. It might have lupus."</DescSuicide_K>

  <DescSuicide_L>A prisoner has been found dead under the bed, and a scrap of paper was found nearby. It looks like a mission report and it reads: "Here is your job. Land at the listed co-ordinates and grab some weapons, ammunition, rations and armor. Then follow us and assault the illegal colony. They shouldn't be here and we're going to enforce that. You may be a rookie but this will be easy. They won't know what hit 'em!".</DescSuicide_L>

  <DescSuicide_M>A prisoner has died. A message was found in a notebook. It reads: "We were waiting for orders when suddenly some air defense shot down our ship! I survived by jumping in the escape pod. When the pod opened I was immediately under fire. I was caught and imprisoned. I don't know what happened to the others. I don't think I'll be leaving this place alive. If you're still monitoring me, let them know what happened and tell them to stay away from this place".</DescSuicide_M>

  <DescSuicide_N>A prisoner has suddenly died. A strange message was found scrawed on a medical paper. It reads "They wanted to do a test procedure on me with experimental bionics and regenerative tissue. They wanted to cut off my leg. So, I passed. I'll show them that I don't need medical help! My flesh and blood is my own, a little infection won't stop me! I AM INVINCIBLE!"</DescSuicide_N>
