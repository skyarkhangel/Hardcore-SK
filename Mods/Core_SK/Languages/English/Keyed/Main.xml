	<DescTrySuicide> tried to commit suicide, but it did not work out.</DescTrySuicide>
	<LabelSuicide>Prisoner Suicide</LabelSuicide>
	<DescSuicide_A>One of your prisoners died in the cell and has left a final message behind. It reads: "Cameras everywhere. Watching. Always watching. The walls all around are moving, watching. Can't sleep, always watching. You see me and I don't see you! No lights here, no no. Watch you in the dark they do. Cameras, eyes of spies! You'll watch me no more!"</DescSuicide_A>
	<DescSuicide_B>Your prisoner smashed it's head against the wall and has died. A small piece of paper nearby has a message that was hastily scrawled. It reads: "I thought there would be easy cash in this Colony...but instead I got trapped into something horrible. I think I'm going crazy. This food...the Warden said it was "yummy, tasty, mmm" but I don't believe it. Something tastes wrong about it. My old injuries still haunt me, like a nightmare that never ends. Even the barely audible sound of the door causes me to shudder as if it were thunder".</DescSuicide_B>
	<DescSuicide_C>A prisoner has committed suicide shortly after asking a Colonist: "Where are my meals? I need nourishment! Muffalo meat or something! GIVE ME FOOD!"</DescSuicide_C>
	<DescSuicide_D>A prisoner who was found dead had kept a diary with multiple entries. It reads: "A rough cough. I feel cold and hot. I caught something, a flu maybe? No ventilation in here. Cough getting worse. My mouth is dry, it tastes like rust*blood splatter covers some words*rible. I see people sometimes, they promised me a future. To think I even liked it! I was promised food, a good bed and could one day use my skills again. I believed that, but not anymore. I need*blood splatter covers more words* worth a try.</DescSuicide_D>
	<DescSuicide_E>A prisoner was found deceased under the bed. A small note was crumpled up nearby. It angrily reads: "They wanted to operate on me! They were going to harvest me for organs! These people are crazies! YOU WON'T HARVEST ME ALIVE! I WON'T LET YOU!</DescSuicide_E>
	<DescSuicide_F>A prisoner has succumbed. A quick look at the body shows signs of infection and gangrene in hidden areas. The pain must have be extruciating.</DescSuicide_F>
	<DescSuicide_G>A prisoner has perished. Scrawled into the floor is a note. It reads: "Suddenly no one comes? Am I going to die here like an abandoned dog in a cage?".</DescSuicide_G> 
	<DescSuicide_H>One of your prisoners suddenly couldn't stand up. The doctor's first thought was that the prisoner's psyche was tender, overwhelmed by the anxiety and depression from imprisonment. Then the prisoner suddenly died! Upon the autopsy examination, a long fat stick was found up the prisoner's rear and had gouged the intestines. What an unfortunate circumstance.</DescSuicide_H>
	<DescSuicide_I>A prisoner has died under mysterious circumstances. The body was found in the fetal position with its hands covering its eyes. The prisoner seems to have choked when it swallowed its own tongue.</DescSuicide_I>
	<DescSuicide_J>A prisoner has died under mysterious circumstances. A quick inspection of the body tells the tale. The prisoner seems to have tried hanging itself with a boot lace, but the lace broke. The prisoner then tried to gnaw off the door handle, as indicated by the bloody bite marks on the door. Failing that the prisoner swallowed part of the boot, where it got lodged in the throat and the prisoner suffocated.</DescSuicide_J>
	<DescSuicide_K>The prisoner died under mysterious circumstances. A medical summary paper was found nearby. It reads: "Patient has distemper, intestinal ticks and show signs of being in a delirious state. Patient has tried to eat it's own feet and hands. I recommend isolating the patient and attempting experimental procedures. It might have lupus."</DescSuicide_K>
	<DescSuicide_L>A prisoner has been found dead under the bed, and a scrap of paper was found nearby. It looks like a mission report and it reads: "Here is your job. Land at the listed co-ordinates and grab some weapons, ammunition, rations and armor. Then follow us and assault the illegal colony. They shouldn't be here and we're going to enforce that. You may be a rookie but this will be easy. They won't know what hit 'em!".</DescSuicide_L>
	<DescSuicide_M>A prisoner has died. A message was found in a notebook. It reads: "We were waiting for orders when suddenly some air defense shot down our ship! I survived by jumping in the escape pod. When the pod opened I was immediately under fire. I was caught and imprisoned. I don't know what happened to the others. I don't think I'll be leaving this place alive. If you're still monitoring me, let them know what happened and tell them to stay away from this place".</DescSuicide_M>
	<DescSuicide_N>A prisoner has suddenly died. A strange message was found scrawed on a medical paper. It reads "They wanted to do a test procedure on me with experimental bionics and regenerative tissue. They wanted to cut off my leg. So, I passed. I'll show them that I don't need medical help! My flesh and blood is my own, a little infection won't stop me! I AM INVINCIBLE!"</DescSuicide_N>

	<observation>\n- Observations:\n  1. the artifact has deployed underground foundations.\n  2. some pylons have been erected near the main structure.\n  3. the artifact seems to generate powerful artificial thunderstorms.\n\n- Deductions:\n  1. this device appears to be a mechanoid terraformer.\n  2. its purpose is to re-shape the surface of this planet to prepare a large-scale invasion.\n\n- Recommandations:\n  1. proceed with *extreme* caution when attempting anything on the artifact!\n  2. deactivating the onboard beacon should be a priority to avoid future invasion.\n  3. consider re-routing the power generated during artificial thunderstorms.\n  4. further research may allow us to take advantage of those artificial thunderstorms.\n</observation>

	<AncientStargate_StudyReport>### Study report ###\n\nStudy subject: Interdimensional ancient artifact.\n\n- Artifact location: </AncientStargate_StudyReport>
	<AncientStargate_Observation>\n- Observations:\n  1. It is a few rings measuring 3.14 meters in diameter.\n  2. Made from exotic material, previously unknown, built by some ancient civilization.\n  3. When the inner ring is rotated, a stable one-way wormhole is created between the calling ring and the called ring, and it looks like you can instantly move any objects into the wormhole ...\n\n- Выводы:
\n  1. We will call this building - Stargate.\n  2. It seems that something is missing in its device and the artifact is able to work only in one direction, as a "receiver".
\n- Recommendations:\n  1. Proceed with *extreme* caution when attempting anything on the artifact! \n  2. Perhaps we will be able to study its device in more detail and use it in the future to move in interdimensional space. \n  3. On the other hand, it may be useful to us for the materials of which it consists, having at first glance, incredible strength.\n</AncientStargate_Observation>
