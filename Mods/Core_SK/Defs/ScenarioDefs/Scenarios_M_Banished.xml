          <text>Your reasons for being here are a mystery to anyone but yourself. Maybe it was something you did to someone. Maybe you pushed your luck too hard. Whatever the cause, you must have left in a great hurry, considering you didn't bring any supplies with you. You receive a transmission on your radio, a familiar voice speaks to you:\n\n"I managed to sneak you out of there, but you need to leave this world ASAP. I wish i could do more for you, but i need to get back before they realize i'm missing or they'll know it was me who helped you escape. Best of luck." \n\nYou'll need a spaceship to get off the planet, but right now you better set up a camp in order to survive.</text>
