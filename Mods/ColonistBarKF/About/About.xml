    <![CDATA[More options for the Colonist Bar, including new status icons and a mood bar.

    Allows custom scaling and sorting functionality.
    All options available with Right Mouse Button click on any colonist portrait.
    FollowMe™ functionality via Middle Mouse Button click.

    Includes icon stats based on 'Pawn State Icons™' by Dan Sadler
    Includes 'FollowMe™' functionality by Fluffy with updated code by alexschrod
    (Needed for more mouse button options. Please deactivate Fluffy's original version in case of any conflicts.)
    Includes 'ZoomToMouse™' functionality by Fluffy (cause I like it and it wasn't updated a few RW alphas back)
