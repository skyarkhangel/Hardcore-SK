  <description>add control units to generators to automatically switch them on and off when needed

&lt;size=24&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;
Adds generator control boxes, which will automatically turn the generators they are attached to on and off depending on current power levels.

Control boxes can be built after researching &lt;i&gt;Backup Power&lt;/i&gt;, a follow-up to &lt;i&gt;Microelectronics&lt;/i&gt;. Once researched, build a power control box on top of any generator to have it automatically toggled on/off depending on the electrical grid’s supply and demand.  

Should work on any power generator that has the ‘flickable’ tag, so any vanilla or modded power producer that can be toggled on and off.

Control boxes have an indicator light that can take three colours:  


blue: control box is in standby, the generator is not currently needed.
green: control box is active, the generator is running.
red: control box error, the generator can not run.

&lt;size=24&gt;Known Issues&lt;/size&gt;
None (yet).
