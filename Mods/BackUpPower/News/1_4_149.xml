You can now set when backup power units should turn on and off. 
|Each backup power unit has a new widget that allows you to set a minimum and maximum threshold. 
|When battery storage drops below the minimum threshold, the unit will turn itself on. When battery storage is again above the maximum threshold, the unit will turn itself off (but only if that would not lead to a power shortage). 
|You can right-click a units' settings to copy them to other units in the same room, connected to the same network, or all other units on the map.
