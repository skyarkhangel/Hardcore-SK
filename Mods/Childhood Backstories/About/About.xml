Adds childhood backstories for colony children. Backstories are assigned based on what the child actually did/experienced for proper immersion. Backstories come with skill modifiers, which are added to the child's skills.

Childhood backstories are populated when the child turns 13, as this is when vanilla assigns the "Colony child" backstory. Teens will have a blank adult backstory, and will have a title based on their childhood backstory. Adults will have the normal adult backstories.

Suggestions for more backstories are welcome!
