  <description>The opposite of the 'Allow non-dead man's apparel' filter for stockpiles and workbenches
  Vanilla gives you the option for stockpiles and workbenches, to exclude apparel which hasn´t been worn by dead man with the filter option 'Allow non-dead man´s apparel'
  But you are unable to exclude apparel which has been worn by dead man. This mod adds a filter for it so you can exclude apparel which has been worn by dead man in stockpiles and workbenches.</description>
