	<description>This mod adds a few functions to the power switch. 
There are various research topics available, which adds to the functionality of the switch.
You can research an upgrade with a motion detector, enemy detector or a timer.
If you spend even more hours into your research, even an enemy detector for automatic switching may be available.

Description:
- Pawn Detection in Room: Available after research with the normal switch. Detects, if an Pawn (human, animal) is in the room
- Pawn Detection within 7 squares: Available after research. Normal pawn detection mode for wall switches. Normal switches can be switched between this mode and the pawn in room mode by repeatedly pressing the selection button.
- Enemy detection (within 1/3 of the map): Available after research. Available modes: Switch on when detected and switch off when detected.
- Timer: Available after research: Switches on and off at specified times. Time is initially set to 19h->On and 5h->Off. This can be changed by pressing the buttons repeatedly
- Hidden power conduits.
