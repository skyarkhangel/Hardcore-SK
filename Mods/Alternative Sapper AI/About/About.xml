This experimental mod modifies Sapper AI and removes some of their original limitations to make them behave differently.

Mod features (for 1.1):
- All humanlike pawns with mining skill above 4 can be delegated to sapper role, not just melee.
- Raiders assigned to escort role can attack nearby non-wall constructed objects instead of just wandering, when given no other things to do after following the sapper.
- Sappers only have 20% chance to avoid turrets. Can be adjusted at mod settings.
