	<RatkinVagabondJoin.letterText>A Ratkin vagabond named {PAWN_nameDef} suddenly felt a strange sensation wash over {PAWN_objective} as {PAWN_pronoun} passed by your colony, and after contemplating for some time, {PAWN_pronoun} has decided to join your community.\n\n{PAWN_pronoun} is willing to contribute, but will not leave voluntarily. If you don't want {PAWN_nameDef}, you can banish {PAWN_objective}, sell {PAWN_objective} into slavery, or simply kill {PAWN_objective}. However, your other colonists may find this disturbing.</RatkinVagabondJoin.letterText>
