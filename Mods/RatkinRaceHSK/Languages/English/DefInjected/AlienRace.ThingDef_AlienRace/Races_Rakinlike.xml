	<Ratkin.description>A humanoid race with rodent genes, readily identified by their large, round ears and thin, scaly tails.\n\nWhile their origins are unknown, most Ratkin societies are generally organized around agricultural monarchies, although a small number of individual Ratkins have been observed seeking employment in predominantly-human cities.\n\nFemales typically outnumber males at a ratio of 9 to 1, but it is often difficult to determine a Ratkin's gender from their outward appearance.</Ratkin.description>
