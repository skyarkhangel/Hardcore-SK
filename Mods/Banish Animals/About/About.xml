  <description>Allows you to banish colony animals.

Are you getting low on food, but are too attached to poor Fluffy to slaughter her? Send her away!

Description
Adds the 'Banish' button from the Character card to the Inspect pane, exclusively for colony animals. All other functionality related to banishing non-human colony pawns was already built into the game, but only accessible from caravan menus.

Savegame compatible.

Should not conflict with any mods, except possibly others that make edits to the Inspect pane (such as RimHUD).

Dependencies
If RimHUD is installed, it must be loaded before this mod, otherwise the button added by this mod will not show up.

Honourable Mentions
