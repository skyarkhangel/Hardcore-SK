	<description>"Greatest hauling mod ever" - Chicken Plucker

	v0.18.1.8
	
Colonists will gather stuff in their inventory, then haul it all to a stockpile.

This hauling mod will greatly increase hauling efficiency, because pawns can now carry more than one gun or t-shirt. Those smart and intelligent colonists can use their inventory!

Should work fine with other hauling mods like AllowTool's Haul Urgently and Stack Merger, but they don't gain the inventory-benefit. Does not conflict with Combat Extended.

Safe to add to existing games.
