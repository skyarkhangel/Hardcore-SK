  <!-- Some calculations for a retuning, Apr 3 2018

-There are 8 joy kinds: 2 with no gear, 4 from buildings, 2 from consumables. You'll generally have 3-6 kinds availabel.
-Joy falls 0.6 per day, but falls slower when low or very low.
-Each tolerance falls independently at a rate of 0.0833 / day
-Since tolerances fall independently, total tolerance fall rate for a pawn depends on the number of tolerances >0 at any time:
    1 kind  live: 0.08 / day
    2 kinds live: 0.17 / day
    3 kinds live: 0.25 / day
    4 kinds live: 0.33 / day
    5 kinds live: 0.42 / day
    6 kinds live: 0.50 / day

-B18 tuning:    Tolerance gain per joy 0.4
    You need to get 0.6 joy per day, thus gaining 0.24 tolerance per day.
    So you only really need to use 3 joykinds to stay ahead of that and remain in the satisfied range.

-1.0 tuning A:  Tolerance gain per joy 0.7
    You need to get 0.6 joy per day, gaining 0.42 tolerance per day.
    This is maintainable with 5 joy kinds.
    Otherwise you'll be in the "low" range with 4 kinds.
    And the very low range/low with 3 kinds.

-1.0 tuning B:  Tolerance gain per joy 0.65
    You need to get 0.6 joy per day, gaining 0.39 tolerance per day.
    0.7 seems a bit harsh, and I want the upper thersholds to be possible, so here I set tolerance gain per joy to 0.65

-1.0 tuning C:  Split tolerance drop rates per expectation level
    Tolerances fall at different rates depending on the expectation level.
    Low expectations retains the old behavior, others are easier and harder. -->
