<MaxNumberOfPlayerHomes.helptext>Warning: RimWorld is designed to be played with one player colony at a time. Though it is possible to have more colonies, this will probably cause performance slowdowns and gameplay imbalances. We recommend that, at least at first, you play the game with a one colony maximum.</MaxNumberOfPlayerHomes.helptext>
