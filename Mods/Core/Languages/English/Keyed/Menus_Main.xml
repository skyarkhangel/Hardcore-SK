  <!-- Main menu dev build -->
  <DevBuildWarning>Warning: This is an unstable development build. This means we are running design experiments and doing technical development.\n\nSome things will be temporarily unbalanced on purpose. This is a classic game design method where we deliberately go too far with a balance change in order to better understand balance boundaries. We can then use that information to decide on the final balance points.\n\nThere will also be bugs, including game-breaking ones. Save compatibility may break any time.\n\nIf you're okay with all of this, thanks for testing! If you don't want to be subject to our experiments, please play the latest stable version.</DevBuildWarning>

  <ReloadAnytimeModeInfo>You can save and load the game at any time.\n\nThis is a good choice if you're still learning the game, if it fits your personal playstyle, if you're using mods that may break your game, or if you intend to self-enforce commitment mode.</ReloadAnytimeModeInfo>
  <PermadeathModeInfo>You can only save when quitting the game.\n\nSince RimWorld is a story generator, even losing all but one person is not the end of the game - it's part of the story. The game is designed to allow recovery after losses.\n\nPlaying out these terrible situations makes a story with both tragedy and triumph. It's the way RimWorld was designed to be played.\n\nThere's a reason Luke Skywalker didn't quit and reload when his family got killed - loss and recovery is dramatic.</PermadeathModeInfo>

  <UnlockExtremeDifficulty>Merciless mode</UnlockExtremeDifficulty>
  <ConfirmUnlockExtremeDifficulty>Merciless mode is a special game mode where every challenge is turned up to extreme levels.\n\nMerciless mode unlocks automatically when you reach specific milestones. However, you can unlock it now.\n\nThis option is only recommended once you've played a high-difficulty game or two and want to have a good chance at dying despite your best efforts.</ConfirmUnlockExtremeDifficulty>
