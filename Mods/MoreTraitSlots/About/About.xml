"More Trait Slots" is a pretty simple mod. It doesn't add new traits to the game, but it will work well with mods that do, as it allows you to configure the minimum and maximum number of traits that pawns will start with. It also adjusts the character display tab so that up to seven (or up to nine with a smaller font) traits can actually be seen.

=====

Compatibility:

"More Trait Slots" can safely be added to or deleted from a game in progress, and shouldn't conflict with any other mods.

If you're using "EdB Prepare Carefully," you might see a warning message if you assign more traits to a pawn than the vanilla character tab would be able to display, but you can safely ignore that message. And you should have no other issues when using the two mods together.
