1.1.27a
- updated for 1.2;
- fixed HugLib's complain about patching obsolete methods;

1.1.26
- added a fix suggested by @BryanAldrich that supposed to fix some issue with forming a caravan;

1.1.25
- made a minor tweak that might or might not help people with their "pawns feed trees to animals" issue;

1.1.24
- fixed random ingredients appearing for cooked meals (caused by changes in 1.1);
- fixed pawns not prioritizing faster spoiling ingredients (caused by changes in 1.1);

1.1.23
- officially added Harmony dependency. Now this mod requires a Harmony mod to work properly. Nothing really changed, because this mod've used Harmony assemblies since the beginning anyway;
- changed, how actions are added to queue to be active after cleaning. Before they was added FORCED, so pawn could understand if he should try to take an opportunistic task again (opportunistic tasks are not taken for FORCED tasks). Now tasks are added to queue normally, and pawns also don't take opportunistic actions that was triggered from queue. It was changed so animals that set to follow pawns when they're on the job wouldn't "follow" the pawn WHILE he's asleep.
- fixed an unintended ability to unload locked out items (from quest characters and etc). New feature that wasn't taken into account after adaptation to a new version;
- fixed a bug that caused pawns to drop and pick up an item indefinitely when unloading. Item drop now triggered by different means than it used to be in 1.0.

1.1.22
- Updated for RimWorld 1.1! Now, that doesn't mean it works at least as good as before, because some things may be broken silently, without me knowing about it, so it may take a bit more time to fine tune everything.

1.1.21
- updated simplified chinese translation. Thanks, HawnHan.

1.1.20
- opportunistic task checker now reverts to default activity if error is occurred (i. e. instead of getting stuck in one error, it'll at least try to avoid it by leaving the rest to default behavior);

1.1.19
- increased interest of animals towards growing plants (over hay);

1.1.18
- separated options to prefer spoiling ingredients and meals;
- added an option that allows pawns to feed animals with hay (and other plants that animals NORMALLY eat). Pawns also gonna PREFER feeding animals with hay (and animals gonna prefer plants over other sources of food). Kind of goes against my understanding, how taming should work (or how normal animal logic should happen), but that balance issue is too minor for me to take immediate action (maybe later).

1.1.17
- added an option to prevent pawns from cleaning snow when it's... snowing. Or raining. In case if it's an uncertain weather.

1.1.16
- changed a thing about pathfinding to be wary of any kind of danger (not just "some") when looking for dirt;

1.1.15
- fixed a minor incompatibility issue with Simple Food Priorities. SFP makes so pawns think that eating unprepared food isn't weird (conditionally), but counting nutrients in inventory still worked the old way. Added additional check to prevent pawns from taking food that is excluded from counting when pawn attempt to pick up meal "in advance".

1.1.14
- fixed the broken fix that supposed to make so prioritization of spoiling medicine didn't count for surgeries. It ended up another way around;
- cleaning opportunities now ignored if it's an errand to build something;

1.1.13
- added a fix for an issue, that caused problems with opportunistic hauling before collecting items to a working place;

1.1.12
- made so doctors don't prioritize faster spoiling medicine for surgeries anymore;
- made so pawns, that require medical attention, don't do opportunistic cleaning errands;
- made so doctors don't clean after tending if their next job is also tending on a pawn that's in the same room or if it's an emergency (bleeding time < 6 hours). Keep in mind that it DOESN'T change, how doctors chose their patients.

1.1.11
- fixed that one thing that broke carpenter's table mod.

1.1.10
- removed empty space at place of a button in inventories for items that can't be marked to unload;
- made so that unstackable "single" items aren't placed in inventory when carried to a crafting place. That way designations on an item aren't canceled, and pawns will not try to "return" corpses and chucks into inventory when an action is canceled;

1.1.9
- fixed an issue, due to which pawns would reserve a stack of materials even if they already took a portion required from it;

1.1.8
- found a reason, why pawns ignored filth limit. They actually did, but since before starting a job they started cleaning again, they just got into restarting loop until room is cleaned. Added forced "add to queue" and marked queued job to be "forced", so pawns wouldn't try to clean after. Hope it doesn't lead to weird interactions;
- also made better checks to ignore non-player pawns earlier;

1.1.7
- changed numbers for opportunistic cleaning (again). Now it's 5 filth patches for everything, except tending (it's unlimited still);
- now you can set your own flith limits in mod settings;

1.1.6
- when pawns unload inventory, their task actually gets canceled midway if you unmark items or drop them;
- if you unmark items to unload, and pawn doesn't have enough space in inventory, that item is dropped on the ground;

1.1.5
- added some more checks for "random ingredients", to possibly remove any issues with unusual recipes;
- rearranged checks for opportunistic cleaning jobs to remove possibilities of pawns ignoring assignments in incapability;

1.1.4c
- a small fix for options that didn't save their state;

1.1.4b
- fixed "WashAtCell" issues on maps with no dedicated cleaning place (i.e. only wells or open water);

1.1.4a
- added an ignore of an error doring ThinkNode patch. 

1.1.4
- when recreating, colonists will prefer taking spare meals if they don't have one;
- fixed a problem, due to which colonists would prefer herbal medicine over any other when doing surgery;
- added a special patch for "dubs bad hygiene" that tweaks assignment priorities (pawns now will prefer to top off all needs during recreation and when not sleeping during sleeping assignment);

1.1.3
- fixed a problem, when material of an item could change with "all components hauled together" on, because order of picking up could change due to path optimization (basically, whatever was closer to the pawn, it automatically become a main ingredient);

1.1.2a
- limited filth cleaning opportunity to 20 (except tending);

1.1.2
- changed pawn priorities for sleeping schedule. Now they'll prioritize topping off joy need if they happen to wake up early;
- added an option to prevent colonists from taking joy activities if they're already topped off (after reaching 95%, they'll not start it again until it's down to 80%);

1.1.1
- added category to item's info;
- added prioritization of spoiling herbal medicine and corpses;
- added prioritization of spoiling food (to eat before it turns bad);
- removed unintentional duplicate in settings;

1.1.0
- added an option to unload equipped items;
- made an option for manual unloading optional;
- added compatibility patch for RPG Style Inventory;
- added an option for pawns to put items back in inventory when they get interrupted (ex. when you draft them during consumption of a meal in the middle of nowhere);
- added an option do prevent pawns from taking more sweets than they can eat;

This is probably the final changes to the mod. For now I've fulfilled all I wanted. I'll make some refactoring and optimization, but I'm out of further ideas for new features :)

1.0.16a
- NOW actually added order optimization when a pawn is hauling ingredients for a recipe;
- added some little changes to merging rules for better compatibility (credits to lilwhitemouse).

1.0.16
- fixed an error on trying to cut stone chunks. Sorry about that;
- added an option to unload an item from an inventory (to the closest stockpile, instead of dropping on the ground).

1.0.15
- made "full recipe descriptions" for apparel simpler;
- added order optimization when a pawn is hauling ingredients for a recipe;
- optimized some things considering ingredients that was left in inventory if hauling was interrupted, but it's hardly noticeable.

1.0.14
- added an option to prefer faster spoiling ingredients for cooking;

1.0.13
- added an option to pick up ALL ingredients before hauling them to the crafting place;
- fixed possible issue with recreational drugs in inventory when "fulfilling outdoors" is triggered;

1.0.12b
- fixed a compatibility issue with "Stockpile Ranking" mod. Probably fixed an issue with Haul Explicitly;

1.0.12a
- updated chinese language;
- changed how cleaning path is calculated for cleaning tasks to reduce backtracking;

1.0.12
- added synergy between a mod "pick up and haul" and a tweak "haul instead of crafting";
- added a GUI tweak, that allows to display complete list of ingredients on recipe screen, instead of just vague "ingredients";
- added an advanced option to let pawns clean the room between hauling ingredients and actual crafting (with normal option they would clean before hauling). This tweak is heavy handed and may break mods that tweak bill jobs.

1.0.11
- add a new feature: pawns now can take into account "potential" mood, what should prevent them from overusing drugs to get above a set level;

1.0.10
- "hauling instead of crafting" now ignores ingredients that do not stack;

1.0.9
- added chinese simplified translation. Credits to 脑子疼 (chrisxlite);

1.0.8:
- added an option to encourage pawns haul things to stockpile if they find ingredients for cooking or crafting outside of a room with crafting station (or if a room is huge or outdoors). It helps to avoid situations, when pawns go to pick up 1-2 ingredients for crafting, instead of hauling a whole stack;
- did some cleaning to avoid some more potential errors;

1.0.7:
- little reshuffling in code for compatibility;

1.0.6:
- revorked, how cleaking job is assigned. Now it uses built in CleanFilth checks instead of it's own. This way, if CleanFilth is rewrited/replaced by a mod, CommonSense will use rules of another mod instead;

1.0.5:
- fixed allowed area cleaning issue;

1.0.4:
- pawns will not try to clean dirt outside of home area any more;
- made a limit, how big room can be. If room is > than 200 cells, pawns will clean only filth that is nearby. Due to added limitation, I also made so pawns will clean even if it's not a room;

1.0.3:
- added translation possibility;
- cleaned up settings;
- separated cleaning after tending as it's own option. Those, who disabled cleaning, sorry for inconvenience. You have to disable it again;
- added an option to generate random ingredients to non-crafted meals. Disabled by default;

1.0.2:
- added a behavior, according to which pawns gonna clean the place where they're supposed to operate a building, or if it's some sort of joy activity. Also pawns clean the room after tending to patient.

1.0.1:
- although still suboptimal, the way, how outdoor recreation is chosen, was significantly improved. Now pawns pick up any activity that would result in hanging out outdoors. It's suboptimal because they still can't chose items, it means they may skip activities, that sometimes done indoors. It would require too much coding and would make this mod likely to conflict with other mods, that's why first case is preferable. So, in order to avoid indecisiveness, don't make the same recreational items both indoors and outdoors ;)
