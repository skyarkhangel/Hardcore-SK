1.0.4
Made an array of fixes:
- reverted previous patch. It made so "drop item" icon now displayed in corpse inventory;
- altered inventory screen in a way so it counts animal's inventory as normal one, but not corpse;
- made so unmarkable items (not ThingWithComps) don't cause troubles when they're in inventory;
- made so unmarkable items drop from inventory automatically (because they can't be marked, and have no comps so they can't deteriorate, rot or decompose);
- tried some cheeky stuff in order to make simple "Thing"s count as "ThingWitchComp"s, but my attempts was futile. Probably gonna try again later.

1.0.3
- fixed one little thing that hid drop button from animal inventory;

1.0.2
- canceling stripping designation now unmarks all items;
