Adds a comprehensive medical overview tab, showing your colonists' health at a glance. 


  
  
![Important](https://banners.karel-kroeze.nl/title/Important.png)
Does not require a new save game 
Can safely be enabled/disabled in ongoing saves. 


  
  
![Features](https://banners.karel-kroeze.nl/title/Features.png)
Shows vital medical statistics for Colonists, Animals, Prisoners, Visitors and Hostiles*.
Medical care designation, including mass and default assignments
Overview of bleeding rates, pain and infection/disease/immunity progress
See efficiency on all capabilities
Schedule new operations and see planned operations
Sort by everything 

*: The hostile tab will by default only show downed hostiles, as I consider showing all hostiles cheating. There's a toggle in the mod options to show all hostiles instead.
