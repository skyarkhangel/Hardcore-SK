  <description>Adds a comprehensive medical overview tab, showing your colonists’ health at a glance. 

&lt;size=24&gt;Important&lt;/size&gt;
Does not require a new save game 
Can safely be enabled/disabled in ongoing saves. 

&lt;size=24&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;
Shows vital medical statistics for Colonists, Animals, Prisoners, Visitors and Hostiles*.
Medical care designation, including mass and default assignments
Overview of bleeding rates, pain and infection/disease/immunity progress
See efficiency on all capabilities
Schedule new operations and see planned operations
Sort by everything 

*: The hostile tab will by default only show downed hostiles, as I consider showing all hostiles cheating. There’s a toggle in the mod options to show all hostiles instead.

&lt;size=24&gt;Powered by Harmony&lt;/size&gt;
