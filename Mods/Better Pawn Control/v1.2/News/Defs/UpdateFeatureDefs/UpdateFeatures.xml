		<content>&lt;b&gt;New feature&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;size=12&gt;Added Emergency toggle to set the 4 policy presets for each tab all at once&lt;/size&gt;|
&lt;b&gt;New feature&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;size=12&gt;Emergency ON automatically interrupts whatever the pawns are doing. You can disable this in the mod's configuration cog&lt;/size&gt;|
&lt;b&gt;Fix&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;size=12&gt;Copy/Paste now works as intended and doesn't break current policies&lt;/size&gt;|
