A set of tools to make your life on the Rim a bit easier.
Easily forbid and unforbid items, select similar things, have things hauled urgently and affect the entire map with powerful new tool extensions.

All tools are found in the Architect &gt; Orders menu. Right-click tools with the small mouse icon to access their whole-map function.

Pressing the Context Action key ("Equals" by default) will activate the whole-map function of the tool you are holding.

All tools are accessible from anywhere by pressing their shortcut key without opening the menu. See the Keyboard configuration panel in the options menu to customize the hotkeys.</description>
