        <description>The minimap window can display several different overlays at the same time.  Some overlays are hidden (off) by default.  You can toggle an entire minimap group on by left-clicking on the icon for the group.  You can also toggle individual overlays by right-clicking the group icon and selecting the individual overlay from the menu.  Additionally, some overlays have more options than just on/off.  These can be accessed through the 'Minimap' mod configuration menu.</description>
