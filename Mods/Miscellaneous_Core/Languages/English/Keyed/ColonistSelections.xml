	<ColonistGroups_GameStartHelp_prt2>The keys 6, 7, 8, 9 can be used to define where colonists should go.\nUse them like this: Draft all the colonists you want to set the positions for and position them at their target positions. Now press SHIFT+7 (for group 7) and the positions of your drafted colonists will be saved. To recall the positions press 7.\nThis can be done for the keys 6, 7, 8 and 9.\nNote: If the group mode (switch: SHIFT+0) is active, they are only selected, but won't go to their positions!</ColonistGroups_GameStartHelp_prt2>
	<ColonistGroups_GameStartHelp_prt3>Key 0 has another function: Once you press it, all your drafted colonists, who don't have an active job, will be undrafted. Press SHIFT+0 to switch the recall mode (6-9) between POSITION and GROUP.\nAdditionally there are the keys SHIFT+Q and SHIFT+E: SHIFT+Q sends your colonist to bed. SHIFT+E sends your colonist to eat. But they will only go, if they are hungry or tired enough.\nFurthermor there is F1. With F1 the camera will jump randomly into your homezone. It is a kind of goto-colony-button.\n\nAll keys can be rebound with your keybinding dialog in the options.</ColonistGroups_GameStartHelp_prt3>
