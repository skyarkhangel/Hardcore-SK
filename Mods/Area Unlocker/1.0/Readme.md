Removes the (arbitrary) limit to the number of areas you can create, change area colours.

# Notes
While this completely removes the limit on the number of areas you can create, the area selection widget in other parts of the UI is untouched - and designed for 5 areas per type. If you create too many areas, you may run into issues. This practical limit depends largely on your resolution and UI size factor. I have no plans to update these UI issues, nor could I do so for all the mods that use areas.
