# Description:

At first would like to thank the creator of the game and all modders whose mods i used.

The idea to create this project, appeared after using other modpacks, in which I didn't like a game balance. Some of its mods greatly simplify the gameplay, making it soon not interesting.
The main idea of the Rimworld to overcome difficulties that you'll encounter when landing on the planet... The more problems you will have, the more interesting it will be your story... You have a goal, a heavy goal - to survive. It make Rimworld worth replaying again and again...

Main focus based on the growing complexity of the gameplay. Trying to achieve greater..Maximally immerse the player into gameplay and stay there for a long time. More than 100 research are waiting. When you start playing, you immediately understand everything... Campfire welcomes you.

This project support English, Russian Spanish and Korean language.
Using additional mods (not included in the project) is not recommended.
