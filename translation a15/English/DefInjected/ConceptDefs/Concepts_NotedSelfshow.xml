    <CoverAndShooting.label>Cover and shooting</CoverAndShooting.label>
    <CoverAndShooting.helpText>The most important thing to do in ranged combat is to use cover.\n\nCover only works if your colonist is touching it, and it is between your colonist and the enemy.\n\nYou can also place colonists behind wall corners.

    <FirePreparation.label>Fire preparation</FirePreparation.label>
    <FirePreparation.helpText>Fires can easily burn down a colony. To defeat them, you must prepare before they happen.
\nThese design elements can help reduce the damage from fires:
\n1. Instead of constructing one super-building, build separate buildings with spaces in between.
\n2. Use less flammable materials. Wood is cheap and fast - but very flammable.
\n3. Build firebreaks to stop wildfires approaching your base. A strip of concrete floor 3 or 4 cells wide will generally stop an advancing fire.</FirePreparation.helpText>

    <FriendlyFireSafety.label>Friendly fire safety</FriendlyFireSafety.label>
    <FriendlyFireSafety.helpText>Friendly fire never occurs if the shooter is close to their ally.\n\nFor example, you can safely put a sword-wielding colonist directly in front of a gun-wielding one. The shooter will fire over his friend's shoulder.\n\nThis is a good way to combine ranged and melee fighters.</FriendlyFireSafety.helpText>
